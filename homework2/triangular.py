## COMP1730/6730 S2 2017 - Homework 2

## The assignment can be done together in pairs, but not in a group of
## more than two students.
##
## If you work in a pair, both students must submit solution files, and
## both students must attend the following lab and answer the tutors
## questions. In this file, you must write a comment to say who you
## worked together with, like this:
##
## I worked together with NNNNNN (ANU id: NNNNNN).
##
## Both of you must be able to explain every part of your submitted
## solution. The tutor will choose who to address each question to, and
## only the student addressed may answer. It is not acceptable to divide
## the assignment up so that one student does half and the other student
## the other half.

## Modify the following function definition so that it computes and
## returns the n:th triangular number. (The statement "return 1" is
## just a placeholder: you should of course modify it.)
def triangular(n):
    return (n * (n + 1)) / 2

## REMEMBER THAT THIS FILE (WHEN YOU SUBMIT IT) MUST NOT CONTAIN ANYTHING
## OTHER THAN YOUR FUNCTION DEFINITION AND COMMENTS.
